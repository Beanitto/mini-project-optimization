# Multiple-type, two-dimensional finite bin packing problem
This is a mini project for Fundamental of Optimization course of SoICT - HUST
## Problem
There are `K` trucks `1,2,...,K` for transporting `N` packages of `1, 2, ..., N`. Trucks have a container size of `Wk * Lk`. Each package `I` has size `wi * li`. Packages that are placed in same container must not overlap. Assume that the number K can be large, leading to a large number of trucks that are not being used. The cost of using truck `k` is `ck`. Find a way to put these package in the trucks so that **the total cost is minimal**.
